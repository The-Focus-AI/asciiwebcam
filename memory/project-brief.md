# ASCII Webcam Art Terminal Application

## Project Overview

A real-time terminal-based application that converts webcam input into full-color ASCII art with various style options. The application focuses on providing an engaging, artistic visualization of webcam feed using ASCII characters while maintaining high performance and user customization.

## Core Features

### Webcam Integration

- Real-time webcam capture and processing
- Full-screen output in the terminal
- Adaptive resolution based on terminal size
- Full color support

### Style Presets

1. Classic ASCII (varying density character sets)
2. Matrix-style rain effect
3. Unicode blocks/symbols:
   - Basic blocks (░▒▓█)
   - Dense blocks (▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█)
   - Line drawing characters (─│┌┐└┘├┤┬┴┼)
   - Braille patterns (⠀-⠿)
   - Super dense combined set
4. Color processing effects:
   - Standard (true color)
   - Neon
   - Vintage
   - High contrast

### User Interface

- Keyboard shortcuts for real-time control
  - Style switching
  - Effect parameters
  - Exit application
- Command-line arguments for initial configuration
  - Style selection
  - Color mode
  - Performance settings
  - Output customization

## Technical Requirements

### System Compatibility

- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Flexible terminal size support
- Automatic adaptation to terminal capabilities (color support, unicode support)

### Performance

- Adaptive frame rate based on system capabilities
- Efficient image processing and conversion
- Minimal CPU/memory footprint

### Webcam Support

- Flexible resolution support
- Auto-detection of available webcam devices
- Graceful fallback for different webcam capabilities

## Error Handling

- Graceful webcam connection/disconnection handling
- Terminal resize handling
- Clear error messages for common issues:
  - No webcam found
  - Insufficient terminal size
  - Unsupported terminal features

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests

   - ASCII conversion algorithms
   - Color processing functions
   - Style preset implementations

2. Integration Tests

   - Webcam capture pipeline
   - Terminal output rendering
   - Command-line argument parsing

3. Performance Tests
   - Frame rate benchmarks
   - Resource usage monitoring
   - Different terminal sizes and capabilities

## Future Considerations

- Custom character set definitions
- Recording/playback functionality
- Additional visual effects
- Network streaming capabilities

## Success Criteria

- Smooth, real-time ASCII art conversion
- Intuitive keyboard controls
- Stable performance across different platforms
- Clear, visually appealing output
- Minimal setup requirements for users
