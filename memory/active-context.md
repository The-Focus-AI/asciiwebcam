# ASCII Webcam - Active Context

## Current Focus

- Setting up testing infrastructure
- Implementing test suite
- Optimizing performance
- Completing documentation

## Recent Changes

- Verified and updated mise configuration (2025.3.0)
- Confirmed all development tools are working:
  - mise for tool and environment management
  - uv for package management
  - Pytest 8.3.5 for testing
  - Ruff 0.11.2 for formatting and linting
  - Coverage tools installed
- Verified application runs correctly through mise
- Updated all memory files to reflect current status

## Next Steps

1. Create tests directory and implement test suite
   - Basic unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Performance tests
   - Coverage reporting
2. Optimize performance
   - Benchmark current performance
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Implement optimizations
3. Complete documentation
   - Update README
   - Create user guide
   - Document development setup
   - Document mise usage

## Active Decisions

- Using mise for tool and environment management
- Using uv for package management
- Switching to Ruff for formatting and linting
- Need to create comprehensive test suite
- Need to implement performance monitoring

## Current Implementation Phase

Phase 4: Testing and Documentation

- Status: In Progress
- Completed:
  - Basic ASCII conversion
  - Multiple character presets
  - Command-line interface
  - Color scheme optimization
  - Status display implementation
  - Fixed display spacing issues
  - mise configuration and verification
- Current:
  - Setting up testing infrastructure
  - Performance optimization planning
- Next:
  - Implement test suite
  - Add performance monitoring
  - Complete documentation

## Open Questions

- What test cases should we prioritize?
- How to structure the test suite?
- What performance metrics should we track?
- What documentation sections are most important?
- How to organize the development guide?
