# ASCII Webcam - Active Context

## Current Focus

- Implementing comprehensive test suite
- Setting up test infrastructure
- Establishing test coverage metrics
- Creating test fixtures and utilities

## Recent Changes

- Fixed color scheme switching
- Optimized color processing with numpy vectorization
- Implemented type-safe buffer management
- Resolved terminal lockup issues
- Added proper frame timing control

## Next Steps

1. Set up testing infrastructure

   - Create tests directory structure
   - Set up pytest configuration
   - Create test fixtures
   - Establish mock objects for camera/terminal

2. Implement core test suites

   - Unit tests for converter
   - Unit tests for color processing
   - Integration tests for display
   - Performance benchmark tests

3. Add test coverage reporting
   - Set up coverage.py configuration
   - Define coverage targets
   - Create coverage reports
   - Track test metrics

## Active Decisions

- Using pytest as primary test framework
- Using pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- Need to mock webcam input for tests
- Need to simulate terminal environment
- Focus on testing critical paths first:
  - Color processing
  - Frame conversion
  - Terminal display
  - Performance metrics

## Current Implementation Phase

Phase 5: Testing and Documentation

- Status: In Progress
- Completed:
  - Basic ASCII conversion
  - Multiple character presets
  - Command-line interface
  - Color scheme optimization
  - Status display implementation
  - Fixed display spacing issues
  - Color scheme switching
  - Buffer management optimization
- Current:
  - Setting up test infrastructure
  - Implementing test suites
- Next:
  - Add test coverage reporting
  - Create performance benchmarks
  - Complete documentation

## Open Questions

- What should be our minimum test coverage target?
- How to effectively mock webcam input?
- How to test terminal display output?
- What performance metrics should we test?
- How to ensure consistent test environment?
- How to test different terminal sizes?
